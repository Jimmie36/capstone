Capstone is my first project submitted for review. Here are some points I've been having problems with.

1. In the header, the "COLMARACADEMY" does't center with the logo. For some reason, I've had this same problem with every project where we have a logo and some text. The menu items center appropriately. I'd appreciate any hints or suggestions as to how to style thise two items.

2. After a lot of trying, I was unable to style the phone display. What I was able to do was style the whole web page to 600px by resizing the css container class. However, when I tried to change the font-size frome 2rem to 1rem in the item h1 class, the change didn't work for the media query. Media queries and styling are new to me. After reading some material in W3C Schools, I see there's a lot to learn here.

3. The thesis video does not play. Although I've included the "controls" property, the buttons do not appear. When I open the file with Windows Movies and TV app, it plays ok.

Thank you in advance for the review. This is my first project to submit for review, and I'm looking forward to the feedback.
